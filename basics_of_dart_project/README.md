# Commenting Code

Dart allows us to comment code aa any other programming language.

There are two ways of writing comments in dart, which are: <br>
        - Single/ Multiple lines comment
        <br>
        - Blocked Comments
        <br>
        - Documentation Comments: Single-line documentation comments begin with ///, while block documentation comments are enclosed between /** and */
        <br>

# Printing output

print ouputs whatever we want in the debug console 
<br>

# Statements & Expression

A Statement is a command given to the computer. All statements in dart terminate with a semi-colon. Besides, all complex statements use curly braces. <br>
An Expression on the otherhand does not do something.

# Arithmetic Operations
1) Add: + <br>
2) Subtract: - <br>

 # Variables & Type Safety

 type name <br>
