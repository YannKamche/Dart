Dart allows us to comment code aa any other programming language.

There are two ways of writing comments in dart, which are: <br>
        - Single/ Multiple lines comment
        <br>
        - Blocked Comments
        <br>
        - Documentation Comments: Single-line documentation comments begin with ///, while block documentation comments are enclosed between /** and */
